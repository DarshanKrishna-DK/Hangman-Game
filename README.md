# Hangman: A classic word guessing game implemented in Python.

   
## Description:

Hangman is a popular word guessing game where players try to guess a hidden word by suggesting letters. If the guessed letter is in the word, it is revealed; otherwise, a part of the hangman is drawn. The game continues until either the player guesses the word correctly or the hangman is complete.

## Features:

* Random Word Selection: The game chooses a random word from a predefined list.
* Guessing Mechanism: Players enter a letter, and the game checks if it's in the word.
* Hangman Visualization: A simple ASCII art representation of the hangman is displayed based on incorrect guesses.
* Win/Lose Conditions: The game ends when the player either guesses the word correctly or the hangman is fully drawn.

## How to Play:

1. Clone the Repository:
`git clone https://github.com/your-username/hangman`

2. Run the Game: Navigate to the cloned directory and execute the [Hangman file](hangman.py).

## Improvements:

1. Word Categories: Allow players to choose a word category (e.g., animals, fruits, countries).
   
2. Difficulty Levels: Implement different difficulty levels based on word length or complexity.
   
3. User Interface: Enhance the user interface with a more visually appealing design.

4. Multiplayer Mode: Add a multiplayer option where two players can compete against each other.
   
5. Virtual Keyboard: Provide a virtual keyboard with letter tracking.

    * Mark letters that have been guessed in green.
    * Mark letters that are incorrect in red.
